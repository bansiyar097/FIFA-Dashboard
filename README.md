## Object of the Project :

The objective of this project is to analyze the FIFA dataset to gain insights into various aspects of players' profiles and contracts. The analysis includes cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and visualizing key metrics.

## Problem Statement:
Given a FIFA dataset with null values and inconsistencies in column formats, perform data cleaning and analysis to answer specific questions about players' demographics, contracts, and skills.

## Action Taken:
**Data Cleaning**:

Excluded null values from plots.

Cleaned the "Value" and "Wage" columns by removing Euro signs, "M", or "K".

Considered only 'years' in the "Contract valid until" column.

**Analysis and Visualization**:

Identified countries with the highest number of players.

Drew a curve showing the year-wise total number of players who joined FIFA.

Used TreeMap to analyze skilled moves based on preferred playing foot.

Calculated the average age of players and identified the top 5 countries with the youngest players.

Determined the number of players whose contracts expire in 2020.

Created a storyboard with body type-wise distribution, position-wise average wages, and variations in average value and wages over the years.


## Insights:

**Player Distribution by Country**:

England, Germany, Spain, Argentina, and France contribute the highest number of players to FIFA.
This indicates that these countries likely have strong football (soccer) programs and talent development systems.

**Growth Rate in Player Addition**:

The growth rate of player addition to FIFA is 80.4%.
This indicates a significant increase in the number of players added to FIFA over the analyzed period.
It suggests a growing interest in football worldwide or potential improvements in talent scouting and recruitment.

**Country Performance vs. Player Contribution**:

Analyzing the performance of national teams from the countries with the highest number of players could provide insights into the correlation between player quantity and team performance.
It could also indicate the effectiveness of talent development programs in these countries.

**Age Distribution and Talent Development**:

Understanding the age distribution of players from Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda, and Botswana could provide insights into the effectiveness of youth development programs in these regions.
Identifying the youngest players from these countries and their performances can shed light on emerging talent pools and potential future stars in football.

**Comparative Analysis**:

Comparing the growth rates of player addition across different regions or continents could highlight disparities in talent development and football infrastructure.
Identifying trends in player demographics (age, nationality, position) could inform strategic decisions for clubs and national teams regarding recruitment and scouting.

**Future Predictions**:

Projecting the growth rate forward could provide insights into potential future trends in player addition to FIFA.
Predicting the emergence of new football powerhouses based on the age distribution of players from certain countries and regions.

**The data highlights strong player contributions from England, Germany, Spain, Argentina, and France to FIFA, alongside an impressive 80.4% growth rate in player additions. Understanding the relationship between player quantity and team performance, as well as analyzing youth demographics in emerging football nations like Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda, and Botswana, offers valuable insights for talent development strategies. These findings underscore the importance of strategic planning and investment in football infrastructure to capitalize on global football growth trends.**
